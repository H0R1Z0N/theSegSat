# theSegSat
Love2D Sega Saturn font viewer  
Install Love2D  https://love2d.org

Screensize is set in the conf.lua file:  

>It's 1200x800 'cuz it shows up OK on my 1280x1024 monitor.  

Copy **font.dat** and **font8.dat** into *theSegSat* dir.  
I could do that here, but I don't think you can include the font in a GPL license...  
  
    There's a trick to open files outside of that dir,  
    but it involves installing luafilesystem...  meh.  
    This is easier.  

Open in Love2D:  

Linux, while inside theSegSat dir:  
>love .

Win, Mac:  
>Drag **theSegSat** folder onto your Love2D shortcut
